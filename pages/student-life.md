## Study Abroad in Russia
![Russia]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resized Russia.jpg){:.img-right}
Although Temple University does not have its own study abroad program in Russia, Temple students do study abroad through a variety of programs in Russia for the summer, semester and entire academic year. [Temple University’s Education Abroad Office](http://studyabroad.temple.edu/) can help you plan your program. Students must complete Russian 2002 (fourth-semester Russian) or its equivalent before participating in a program overseas. Studying abroad is a life-changing experience that will give you the language and intercultural skills you need to use Russian in your career in government, business, media, education or a non-profit agency.

We encourage students to consider applying for scholarships through the [National Security Education Program](http://iiepassport.org/). If you are a Pell Grant Recipient you can apply for the [Benjamin Gilman International Scholarship Program](http://www.iie.org/programs/gilman-scholarship-program). Another terrific funding opportunity is the [Boren Scholarship](https://borenawards.org/).

## Awards and Scholarships
The Department of French, German, Italian and Slavic provides an annual award to exceptional students of Russian. Our students have also received support for study abroad in Russia from the [American Council for Teachers of Russian (ACTR)](http://www.actr.org/).

## Internships and Community Service
Students have had the opportunity to intern at the Philadelphia branch of the Mid-Atlantic Russia Business Council in areas such as web design, communications, seminar planning, and general administration. Our Russian heritage speakers also had the opportunity to intern at the offices of state representatives from Northeast Philadelphia where they worked as liaisons with the Russian community.

Russian students also have the opportunity to participate in community service by working together with the Russian faculty to recruit students from local area high schools who participate in the annual Russian Olympiada. 2016 marked the tenth year for the Delaware Valley High School Olympiada of Spoken Russian. 92 students representing five schools from Pennsylvania and New Jersey registered to compete in 2 categories: Regular Learners and Heritage Speakers. For the second time, individual learners participated in the competition, alongside the school teams coached by their experienced Russian teachers: Marian Barnum, Vlada Jackson, Konstantin Lyavdansky, Amy Wojcik.

We thank all the teams and their teachers for the high oral proficiency level they demonstrated during the Olympiada. This year’s winners are: Alphonso Gonzalez (4R, Vineland High School, NJ; Russian teacher: Vlada Jackson ) and Natalya Ter-Saakov (4H, Eastern High School, NJ; independent).
