## Study Abroad in Russia

Although Temple University does not have its own study abroad program in Russia, Temple students do study abroad through a variety of programs in Russia for the summer, semester and entire academic year. Temple University’s Education Abroad Office can help you plan your program. Students must complete Russian 2002 (fourth-semester Russian) or its equivalent before participating in a program overseas. Studying abroad is a life-changing experience that will give you the language and intercultural skills you need to use Russian in your career in government, business, media, education or a non-profit agency.

We encourage students to consider applying for scholarships through the National Security Education Program. If you are a Pell Grant Recipient you can apply for the Benjamin Gilman International Scholarship Program. Another terrific funding opportunity is the Boren Scholarship.

American Councils for International Education: ACTR/ACCELS offers summer, semester, and academic year programs in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Vladimir. ACTR also began offering programs in Almaty (Kazakhstan) in 2014.
Middlebury College’s Schools Abroad offers programs in Moscow, Yaroslavl’, and Irkutsk.
The Council on International Educational Exchange offers summer, semester, and academic year programs in St. Petersburg.
The School of Russian and Asian Studies offers summer, semester, and academic year programs in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod, Irkutsk, Khabarovsk, and Vladivostok.
