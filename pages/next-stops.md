## Careers

Russian provides students with the opportunity to pursue careers in many diverse areas. Former students of Russian are now working or have worked as engineers at NASA’s Johnson Space Center with Russian cosmonauts training for the Space Shuttle, at banks operating in international markets, as professors of Russian literature at small colleges and large universities, in major accounting firms in Russia and in the US, in large and small law firms, in press offices in Russia, Europe and America, in the State Department and Commerce Department of the federal government, in the FBI, in the Peace Corps, as English teachers in Russian high schools, and for non-profit agencies such as the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the National Foreign Language Center, and the US-Russia Business Council. Some former Russian students have worked for the American Council of Teachers of Russian (ACTR) and the International Research and Exchange Board (IREX) both in the US and in Russia.

## Internships/Community Service

Students have had the opportunity to intern at the Philadelphia branch of the Mid-Atlantic Russia Business Council in areas such as web design, communications, seminar planning, and general administration. Our Russian heritage speakers also had the opportunity to intern at the offices of state representatives from Northeast Philadelphia where they worked as liaisons with the Russian community.

Russian students also have the opportunity to participate in community service by working together with the Russian faculty to recruit students from local area high schools who participate in the annual Russian Olympiada. 2016 marked the tenth year for the Delaware Valley High School Olympiada of Spoken Russian. 92 students representing five schools from Pennsylvania and New Jersey registered to compete in 2 categories: Regular Learners and Heritage Speakers. For the second time, individual learners participated in the competition, alongside the school teams coached by their experienced Russian teachers: Marian Barnum, Vlada Jackson, Konstantin Lyavdansky, Amy Wojcik.

We thank all the teams and their teachers for the high oral proficiency level they demonstrated during the Olympiada. This year’s winners are: Alphonso Gonzalez (4R, Vineland High School, NJ; Russian teacher: Vlada Jackson ) and Natalya Ter-Saakov (4H, Eastern High School, NJ; independent).
