## Study Abroad in Russia

Although Temple University does not have its own study abroad program in Russia, Temple students do study abroad through a variety of programs in Russia for the summer, semester and entire academic year. Temple University’s Education Abroad Office can help you plan your program. Students must complete Russian 2002 (fourth-semester Russian) or its equivalent before participating in a program overseas. Studying abroad is a life-changing experience that will give you the language and intercultural skills you need to use Russian in your career in government, business, media, education or a non-profit agency.

We encourage students to consider applying for scholarships through the National Security Education Program. If you are a Pell Grant Recipient you can apply for the Benjamin Gilman International Scholarship Program. Another terrific funding opportunity is the Boren Scholarship.
